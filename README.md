Welcome to the HandWave project! HandWave is a hand gesture desktop software control application that allows users to interact with various desktop software using hand gestures and poses. The application is built in Python and incorporates a machine learning model to detect and interpret hand gestures accurately.

## Features

HandWave comes with the following features:

1. **Hand Gesture Control**: The application uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and interpret hand gestures and poses.

2. **PowerPoint Control**: Users can advance or go back slides in PowerPoint presentations using hand gestures.

3. **Slideshow Mode**: HandWave allows users to toggle PowerPoint slideshow mode on and off with a specific hand pose.

4. **Customizable Commands (Work in Progress)**: The next phase of development involves identifying the currently selected software, enabling users to customize the commands associated with each gesture and pose for different applications.

## Project Setup

To set up HandWave on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: [project-repository-url](https://github.com/octorose/desktopappgtech).

2. Install the required dependencies by following the instructions provided in the `README` file of the project.

3. Launch the application.

## Usage

To control PowerPoint presentations:

1. Run the HandWave application on your computer.

2. Position yourself in front of the camera.

3. Use specific hand gestures to advance or go back slides in the presentation.

To toggle PowerPoint slideshow mode:

1. Use a predefined hand pose to switch between slideshow mode and normal mode.

2. The application will detect the pose and perform the corresponding action.

## Machine Learning Model

HandWave leverages a machine learning model trained on hand gesture data to accurately recognize user actions. The model uses techniques like LSTM for gestures recognition to interpret hand gestures and respond accordingly.
